# CO2 Emissions - Multiple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict CO₂ emissions based on multiple vehicle-related features. The dataset includes information such as engine size, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions from different vehicles.

---

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore and build a regression model that predicts the CO₂ emissions of vehicles using relevant predictors. This project is a part of learning how to apply regression techniques in machine learning.

## Steps Involved in the Project

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Loaded the dataset and explored its structure using Python libraries like `pandas`.
   - Visualized the relationships between features using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identified multiple independent variables (e.g., engine size, fuel consumption) and used them to predict CO₂ emissions.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
   - Split the data into training and testing datasets.

4. **Model Implementation**:
   - Applied **Multiple Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn` to find the relationship between predictors and the target variable.
   - Generated regression coefficients to analyze the impact of each feature.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using:
     - **R² Score**
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - Plotted residuals to assess model performance.

6. **Insights**:
   - Summarized the relationship between the predictors and CO₂ emissions.
   - Highlighted how the model can be improved further with additional features or other techniques.
